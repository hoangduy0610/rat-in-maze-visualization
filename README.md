## Introduction

In this project, we provide a visual representation of the solution to the Rat In Maze problem. The maze is represented as a grid, where the rat starts at a specific position and needs to find its way to the destination. The rat can only move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The goal is to find a path from the starting point to the destination, avoiding any obstacles in the maze.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of the Rat In Maze solution
- Customizable maze size and obstacles
- Step-by-step visualization of the rat's movement (With Backtracking algorithm)
- Highlighting of the path taken by the rat

## Installation
